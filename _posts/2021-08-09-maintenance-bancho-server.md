Things are changed from this update:
- Multiple login from IRC/mixed login IRC and Bancho support attempt.
- Fix duplicate message when talking in IRC.
- New PP-related feature that will be updated over time.
  This also announces that we never support Tillerino like PP caching because it's weird af.
- Change message targetting when using commands, which can be seen by command issuer most of the time.

Note:
- Mentioned time range is rough estimation of the testing.
- Please avoid long multiplayer session unless told to do so.
- Frequent restarts will happen depending on severity of bugs that happens during the testing.
