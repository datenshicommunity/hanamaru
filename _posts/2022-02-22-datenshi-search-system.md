Good Afternoon, Little Demons!

Today, we are announcing an upcoming feature teaser!

The **Datenshi Isolated osu!direct**! This is an attempt to mimic in-game search system with several features.

As of now Datenshi supports **two search modes**. The deprecated default one and the upcoming new one, which is backed by new search internal system.

To access either modes by choice, you need to supply certain prefixes that is accepted by the system.

|Mode|Prefixes|
|:-:|:-:|
|Default|`b!`/`bancho!`|
|Datenshi|`d!`/`dt!`/`datenshi!`|

Otherwise, by not supplying prefixes users will phase out the search system from time to time.

|Phase|Time|
|:-:|:-:|
|Public Test|2022 March 1st, 7:00 UTC+7|
|Public Use|2022 May 1st, 7:00 UTC+7|

After 1st May, default search system will be **Datenshi Search.**
